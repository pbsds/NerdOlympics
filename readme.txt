=== Nerd Olympics ===
thrown together by pbsds aka Peder Bergebakken Sundt

== Epilepsy warning ==
This game contains a lot of flashing colors and moving objects!
You can greatly reduce this by enabling "epilepsy_safe" in the config.ini file.

== What is this? ==
A quick and dirty game testing you on your mad sniping, alphabeth writing and spamming speed. Complete with scoreboard!

Keep in mind it uses the norwegian alphabet, which can be changed in alphabet.py:
Search (CTRL+F) for "self.target = " and you'll find it ;)

== Dependencies ==
This requires pygame to run.
Written and tested on windows with python 2.7.3
It'll probably only work on windows, because of it's use of glob, i guess...? Havent tried it :/
